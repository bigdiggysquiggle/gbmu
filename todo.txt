ideally find a way to map several arrays into one super array
--seems entirely possible, tough part is managing IO masks
---echoed memory can be the same array put in twice

above seems doable by putting everything into a gameboy class
-still need to work out how to bit mask IO properly
--make i/oreg a class and define =operator?
---would need to do for vram too in order to handle modes

have save states first export cpu variables, then append with all the ram info from the mmu

fix sprite reading/printing. determine where the bug is and fix it

verify whether or not mbc carts always have ram
--halt_bug.gb

instr_timing is borked

interrupt_time is borked

mem_timing is borked

oam_bug isn't preserved

implement sound

background implementation needs to be ironed out, then figure
out proper implementation of window rendering
